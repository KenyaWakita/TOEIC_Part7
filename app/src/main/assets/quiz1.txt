We are very sorry to hear that the color of the coral errings CR-304 you ordered through our spring catalog did not meet your expectations.
We always do our best to make sure the colors in our catalog represent as accurately as possible the colors of our gems. However, colors are extremely difficult to reproduce exactly. Furthermore, the shades of gems tend to vary from stone to stone.
Unfortunately, as indicated at the top of each page in the catalog, our company policy dictates that we cannot accept the return of pierced earrings for hygienic reasons. Accordingly, we hereby send you back the product. 
I am sure that you can understand our position and look forward to serving you in some way in the future.
